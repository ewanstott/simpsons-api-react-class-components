//Alot of answers are in the todo list

- loop over all characters
- produce components for characters
- make character look left or right (conditional rendering)
-
- add favourite/delete button
- think about where the state needs to live and the functions needed in the parent (lifting state)

LAYOUT (HARDCODE THIS TO START)

Start with: Spinner + loading characters...

Header component

Search component - heart icon with favourite count

Character component (name, quote, image) - favourite & delete button

- use conditional rendering to make characters look in opposite direction

'Think about where the state lives, how to get everything into the top, then pass it down, and how to divide things up into the correct # of components
